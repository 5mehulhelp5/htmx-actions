# MageHx_HtmxActions

Magento 2 module that provides a base controller to manage HTMX requests.

---

## ✨ Features

An HTMX request expects an HTML snippet in response, which will be dynamically swapped into the frontend page.

This module provides an abstract controller, MageHx\HtmxActions\Controller\HtmxAction, designed to simplify this process.

It offers a convenient base for handling common HTMX response scenarios, allowing you to return HTML fragments efficiently and consistently.
